# Node / Beehive Interaction

## Node Registration

### Using registration key

An ssh key pair is used to register the node with beehive. The keys should be copied to:

* Private Key -> Node at `/root/id_rsa_waggle_registration`
* Public Key -> Beehive at `$BEEHIVE_ROOT/ssh_keys/id_rsa_waggle_aot_registration.pub`

### Ad-hoc registration

Credentials can manually be generated by running:

```sh
cd beehive-server/beehive-cert
./register-nodes 0000000000000001 0000000000000002 ...
```

Note: Node IDs are all hexidecimal strings which are 16 characters long.

Credentials will be created under:
```
$BEEHIVE_ROOT/SSL/nodes/node_NODEID
```
